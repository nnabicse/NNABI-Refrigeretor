                <h2 className='heading'>History</h2>
                <p>NNABI Refrigeretion was founded as a grocery trading store on March 1, 1933, by Nurun Nabi. He started his business in Bangladesh, trading noodles and other goods produced in and around the city and exporting them to China and its provinces. After the War, he expanded his business into textiles and opened the largest woolen mill in BD. He focused heavily on industrialization with the goal of helping his country redevelop itself after the war. During that period his business benefited from the new protectionist policies adopted by the Korean government, whose aim was to help large domestic conglomerates by shielding them from competition and providing them easy financing. In the late 1950s the company acquired three of BD's largest commercial banks as well as an insurance company and firms that made cement and fertilizer. Samsung in the 1960s acquired more insurance companies as well as an oil refinery, a nylon company, and a department store.</p>
